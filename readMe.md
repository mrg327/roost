# Roost - Nesting To-Do Items

## What is it?

Roost is an app concept that I came up with to supplement the way my brain works.
As I am doing a task, I often find that there are subtasks, and subtasks for those subtasks that come up.
This can lead one's workflow to become interrupted and make getting those tasks done harder.
Enter Roost. One can describe the highest level tasks that they would like to complete and create a "nest".
Each nest can contain "eggs" representing the subtasks required to finish the highest level nest.
If a subtask generated a subtask, the egg will "hatch" into its own nest with its own eggs.
